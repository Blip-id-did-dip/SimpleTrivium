# SimpleTrivium
A basic implementation of the Trivium Cipher


This implementation is based on what I read in the fourth addition of Cryptography: Theory and Practice by Stinson and Paterson


Trivium was designed by De Canniere and Preneel. It is a stream cipher generated by a known 10 byte random initial value and a secret 10 byte key.


There is some question as to the effectiveness of the Trivium cipher, it would be unwise to use this program for a serious application, notwithstanding a lack of flaws I have introduced in my implementation. Currently in this implementation the encryption of a byte does not affect the encryption of any other byte. In other words, changing a byte in the encrypted file will only change that byte in the decrypted file.

The endianess of how the bitstream was generated may not match what you expect.


The encrypted file format is as follows:
- the first 10 bytes are the initial value (Unencrypted as they are needed for decryption)
- 1 encrypted byte indicating the length in bytes of the file name
- the encrypted bytes of the file name
- the encrypted bytes of the file itself
